# YOLOV3 #google_collab

#note : Intially we are going to implement on YOLO V3 and not YOLO_tiny.We will describe steps to use YOLO_tiny later in the same tutorial.

Installation of YOLO V3 and object detection using the same on our own custom data set.The following is done in Google collab https://colab.research.google.com/ . You can try the same in google collab.
